These climate sensors are designed for the LIFE-IP Climate adaption project in Apeldoorn. The sensors measures temperature, humidity and air quality.
The sensors are mounted in lampposts and communicate via LoRAWan with the TTN network.

## Requirements 
- The sensor measures each 2.5 minutes temperatue, humidity and particular matter PM1.0, 2.5 and 10
- The sensor sends the measurements to the TTN network using LoRaWan radio
- The sensor can be mounted on lamppost (case IP65)
- The sensor operates on LiPo battery (for minimal 18 hours) and can be charged by 230V supply 
- The sensor battery is charged at night by the lamppost
- GPS location and battery voltage are reported at regular intervals
